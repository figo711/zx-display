# ZetaX Display

> This project was initially started on August 30, 2022.

In this project, I use `React`, `Typescript`, `Tauri`, and `Vite`, and `Terra Money API`. The main goal is to display currency prices and calculate differences between `Astroport` and `Terra` currency pairs.  
Check out the image below for a sample (note: all values are zero as I haven't updated the API fetch function yet).
